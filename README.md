# Big Tech Political Realignment: From Democrat to Republican Support

A research repository tracking and analyzing the political shift of major technology companies and their leaders from historically supporting Democratic candidates to increasingly aligning with Republican/Trump-aligned positions.

## Research Questions

1. **Timeline**: When did the shift begin and what were the key inflection points?
2. **Motivations**: What factors drove this realignment (regulatory pressure, cultural backlash, economic incentives, personal ideology)?
3. **Actors**: Which executives, companies, and investors have shifted most notably?
4. **Policy Implications**: How has this shift affected tech policy, antitrust enforcement, and content moderation?
5. **Financial Flows**: How have political donations and lobbying expenditures changed?
