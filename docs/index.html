            <h1>Big Tech's Political Realignment</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">From Democratic donors to Trump supporters: A timeline of Silicon Valley's rightward shift</p>
        </header>

        <article class="intro-article">
            <p>Silicon Valley was supposed to be different. The founding mythology was explicitly countercultural: barefoot engineers in garages, dropouts who rejected corporate America, idealists who believed technology could democratize everything. The whole thing emerged from the San Francisco Bay Area—one of the most consistently left-wing regions in the country, home to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Free-Speech-Movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkeley's Free Speech Movement</a>, Stanford's anti-war protests, and the kind of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/05/lsd-microdosing-silicon-valley-creativity-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casual LSD experimentation</a> that would get you fired anywhere else.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/06/ff-stewart-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Whole Earth Catalog</strong></a> (1968-1972) became the unofficial bible—Stewart Brand's hippy manifesto that Steve Jobs famously called "Google before Google." It preached access to tools, communal living, and information freedom. The early hackers at Stanford and MIT saw themselves as liberators, not capitalists. The <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/personal-computers/17/312" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew Computer Club</a>, where Wozniak showed off the first Apple prototype, was essentially a tech commune.</p>

            <p>The geography reinforced the politics. Stanford, Berkeley, UCSF, Santa Clara—the universities feeding the Valley's talent pipeline were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/universities-politics-liberal-conservative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly progressive institutions</a>. San Francisco's <a href="https://www.history.com/articles/san-francisco-gay-rights-movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gay rights movement</a>, anti-Vietnam protests, and environmental activism weren't separate from tech culture; they were the water these engineers swam in. When Google adopted <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Don't Be Evil"</a> as its motto, nobody laughed.</p>

            <div class="intro-quote">
                <blockquote>"We thought we were building tools for liberation. The PC was going to democratize computing, the internet was going to democratize information, social media was going to democratize speech."</blockquote>
                <cite>— A common refrain from early Silicon Valley engineers</cite>
            </div>

            <p>For decades, the posture held. Tech billionaires <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/10/big-tech-2020-election-donations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donated overwhelmingly to Democrats</a>. They advocated for immigration reform, climate action, LGBTQ rights. Apple marketed itself on privacy, Google on openness, Facebook on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745085/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-rebrand-meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connection</a>. The industry's self-image was clear: we're not like those other corporations. We're the good guys.</p>

            <p>So what happened?</p>

            <p>Between 2016 and 2025, virtually every major figure in Silicon Valley either explicitly endorsed Trump, attended his inauguration, donated to his campaign, or publicly reversed their prior progressive positions. The timeline below tracks that shift—from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/us/politics/peter-thiel-republican-convention-speech.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Thiel's lonely 2016 RNC speech</a> to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62505z45g5o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">front row of tech CEOs at the 2025 inauguration</a>.</p>

            <p>Some of it was money. Some of it was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/how-covid-became-culture-war/620149/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID</a>. Some of it was the perception that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/opinion/culture/google-employee-walkout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive employees had captured corporate culture</a>. Some of it was the slow realization that "Don't Be Evil" was always marketing. Whatever the cause, the transformation is now complete. The garage hippies became the establishment.</p>

                <p>Kamala Harris's endorsement of a <strong>25% unrealized capital gains tax</strong> on fortunes over $100 million became a rallying cry for tech opposition. Unlike traditional capital gains taxes triggered by selling assets, this would tax paper wealth annually—forcing founders to sell shares or take loans just to pay the IRS.</p>

                        <li><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> $50-100+ billion</li>
                        <li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg:</strong> $30-40 billion</li>

                </div>
                <p>Andreessen Horowitz's "Little Tech Agenda" declared the proposal would <em>"absolutely kill both startups and the venture capital industry."</em> This framing—that Democratic tax policy threatened the existence of Silicon Valley—gave ideological cover for Trump endorsements.</p>
