            <h1>Big Tech's Political Realignment</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">From Democratic donors to Trump supporters: A timeline of Silicon Valley's rightward shift</p>
        </header>

        <article class="intro-article">
            <p>I grew up as a kid into science. My family had a subscription to <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Scientist</a>, and it was full of early hope for what AI could do for healthcare, the physics yet to be discovered, the diseases yet to be cured. Technology was going to solve problems. The people building it were the good guys.</p>

            <p>Silicon Valley was supposed to be different. The founding mythology was explicitly countercultural: barefoot engineers in garages, dropouts who rejected corporate America, idealists who believed technology could democratize everything. The whole thing emerged from the San Francisco Bay Area—one of the most consistently left-wing regions in the country, home to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Free-Speech-Movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkeley's Free Speech Movement</a>, Stanford's anti-war protests, and the kind of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/05/lsd-microdosing-silicon-valley-creativity-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casual LSD experimentation</a> that would get you fired anywhere else.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/06/ff-stewart-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Whole Earth Catalog</strong></a> (1968-1972) became the unofficial bible—Stewart Brand's hippy manifesto that Steve Jobs famously called "Google before Google." It preached access to tools, communal living, and information freedom. The early hackers at Stanford and MIT saw themselves as liberators, not capitalists. The <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/personal-computers/17/312" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew Computer Club</a>, where Wozniak showed off the first Apple prototype, was essentially a tech commune.</p>

            <p>The geography reinforced the politics. Stanford, Berkeley, UCSF, Santa Clara—the universities feeding the Valley's talent pipeline were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/universities-politics-liberal-conservative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly progressive institutions</a>. San Francisco's <a href="https://www.history.com/articles/san-francisco-gay-rights-movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gay rights movement</a>, anti-Vietnam protests, and environmental activism weren't separate from tech culture; they were the water these engineers swam in. When Google adopted <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Don't Be Evil"</a> as its motto, nobody laughed.</p>

            <div class="intro-quote">
                <blockquote>"We thought we were building tools for liberation. The PC was going to democratize computing, the internet was going to democratize information, social media was going to democratize speech."</blockquote>
                <cite>— A common refrain from early Silicon Valley engineers</cite>
            </div>

            <p>For decades, the posture held. Tech billionaires <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/10/big-tech-2020-election-donations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donated overwhelmingly to Democrats</a>. They advocated for immigration reform, climate action, LGBTQ rights. Apple marketed itself on privacy, Google on openness, Facebook on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745085/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-rebrand-meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connection</a>. The industry's self-image was clear: we're not like those other corporations. We're the good guys.</p>

            <p>So what happened?</p>

            <p>Between 2020 and 2025, virtually every major figure in Silicon Valley who had publicly supported Democrats either explicitly endorsed Trump, attended his inauguration, donated to his campaign, or publicly reversed their prior progressive positions. The timeline below tracks that shift—from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/elon-musk-says-hell-vote-republican-2022-05-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk's 2022 Republican declaration</a> to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62505z45g5o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">front row of tech CEOs at the 2025 inauguration</a>.</p>

            <p>Some of it was money. Some of it was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/how-covid-became-culture-war/620149/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID</a>. Some of it was the perception that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/opinion/culture/google-employee-walkout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive employees had captured corporate culture</a>. Some of it was the slow realization that "Don't Be Evil" was always marketing. Whatever the cause, the transformation is now complete. The garage hippies became the establishment.</p>

                <p>Kamala Harris's endorsement of a <strong>25% unrealized capital gains tax</strong> on fortunes over $100 million became a rallying cry for tech opposition. Unlike traditional capital gains taxes triggered by selling assets, this would tax paper wealth annually—forcing founders to sell shares or take loans just to pay the IRS.</p>

                <p>Andreessen Horowitz's "Little Tech Agenda" declared the proposal would <em>"absolutely kill both startups and the venture capital industry."</em> This framing—that Democratic tax policy threatened the existence of Silicon Valley—gave ideological cover for Trump endorsements.</p>

        <section class="implications">
            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <div class="implications-content">
                <p>The political realignment of a handful of tech billionaires might seem like celebrity gossip. It isn't. The structure of Silicon Valley means these few individuals have <strong>outsized influence over the entire technology ecosystem</strong>—and increasingly, over American democracy itself.</p>

                <h3>The VC Bottleneck</h3>
                <p>Startup culture isn't set by founders. It's set by the people who fund them. A16z alone has <a href="https://a16z.com/portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$35 billion under management</a> and stakes in thousands of companies. When Andreessen and Horowitz publicly endorse Trump and publish manifestos declaring DEI an "enemy," that signal propagates through every founder seeking their money, every portfolio company seeking their approval, every employee hoping for their network. The political preferences of perhaps a dozen major VCs shape the acceptable discourse for an entire industry.</p>

                <h3>The Lost Lever of Employee Activism</h3>
                <p>For a decade, left-leaning tech employees served as an internal check on corporate behavior. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google walkouts</a> over sexual harassment, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/technology/amazon-climate-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon climate protests</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277423/facebook-employees-open-letter-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump-post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook employee letters</a> over Trump policies—these weren't just PR headaches. In a world of <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-12/why-computer-occupations-are-behind-strong-stem-employment-growth.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronic engineering talent shortages</a>, they represented real leverage. Companies moderated their worst impulses because the employees who could walk out and get hired elsewhere within a week demanded it.</p>

                <p>That leverage is now being dismantled. Zuckerberg's "masculine energy" rebrand, the mass layoffs of 2022-2023, the explicit targeting of DEI programs—these aren't just culture war posturing. They're a systematic effort to reshape the workforce that once held these companies accountable. When employees fear for their jobs, they stop writing open letters.</p>

                <h3>The Next Generation</h3>
                <p>Perhaps most consequentially, a new cohort of founders is being formed right now in San Francisco—and they're learning a very different set of lessons than their predecessors. The message from the most powerful people in tech is now explicit: progressive politics is bad for business, DEI is the enemy, and the path to funding runs through ideological alignment with the new establishment.</p>

                <p>The young founders taking meetings on Sand Hill Road today aren't hearing about "Don't Be Evil." They're hearing about the "Little Tech Agenda." They're seeing that the founders who succeeded—Musk, Zuckerberg, the a16z portfolio—did so by abandoning whatever progressive pretenses they once held. The selection pressure is now running in the opposite direction: the next generation of tech leaders is being filtered for their willingness to align with power, not their commitment to principle.</p>

                <h3>The Democratic Deficit</h3>
                <p>This matters beyond tech. These companies control the infrastructure of modern communication. They decide what speech is amplified and what is suppressed. They shape the information environment in which elections are contested. When Zuckerberg ends fact-checking, when Musk turns Twitter into a MAGA megaphone, when Bezos blocks his own newspaper's endorsement—these aren't just business decisions. They're interventions in democracy by people accountable to no one.</p>

                <p>The countercultural founders in garages had one thing right: technology is power. They just didn't anticipate that power would end up so concentrated, or that the people wielding it would so completely abandon the values they once claimed to hold.</p>
