## The Thiel Paradox

### Contradictions

### Resolution
- Power over principle
- Libertarianism for me, authority for thee
- Gay acceptance achieved, now: pull ladder up?
- Contrarian = currently contrarian to mainstream left

## Why He Matters Most

1. **First mover**: Supported Trump when no one in tech would
2. **Kingmaker**: JD Vance is Vice President
3. **Ideological**: Provided intellectual framework
4. **Network**: PayPal Mafia political activation
5. **Template**: Showed tech → politics path
6. **Business model**: Palantir as tech-government fusion
